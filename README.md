# ManualImageClassifier

Classify images manually to create training and test sets for machine learning applications.

We for example used it to make a training set on which we train a neural net to classify if a photo is a photo of a plate with food.

Add a directory ~/Developer/TestImages, where you store the images you want to classify.
This app will move the images inside TestImages into Subfolder /Good and /Bad depending on the key you press.
Left key means bad. Right key means good. And backspace means back.
